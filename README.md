# Commit Format

Simple CLI tool to format text in lines of a particular length. Made to save some annoyance with formatting commit body messages to adhere to line length restrictions. Copies the result to clipboard for convenience.

Written in Rust just for experimentation and learning.

## Running, building, testing

Pretty straightforward, using Cargo.

- `cargo run`
- `cargo build`
- `cargo test`
